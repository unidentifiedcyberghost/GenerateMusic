Overview:
- Key: A minor
- BPM: 130

- Instruments: Piano (use a warm acoustic grand), Bass (use clean sine/sub), add reverb & lo-fi tape saturation for the intro/effects.

Step-by-step tutorial to use the files in your DAW
-------------------------------------------------
1. Download and unzip the package.
2. Open your DAW (Ableton, FL Studio, Logic, Reaper...).
3. Import the multi-track MIDI file 'full_multi_track.mid' (recommended) or import individual MIDI files into separate MIDI tracks:
   - Load 'midi_left_hand.mid' into a MIDI track and set instrument to Piano. Lower octave for warm sustain.
   - Load 'midi_right_hand.mid' into another MIDI track for the arpeggios. Use a bright piano or electric piano.
   - Load 'midi_bass.mid' into a MIDI track and use a sine/sub bass instrument or 808 synth.
   - Load 'midi_chords.mid' as an additional harmonic layer (pad or electric piano).
   - Load 'midi_hook.mid' on a plucked lead or bright piano for the melodic hook in the upper octave.
4. Set project tempo to 130 BPM.
5. Add effects:
   - Reverb (medium-large) on piano for dreamy ambient.
   - Tape saturation / vinyl emulation & mild EQ lo-cut for Lo-Fi intro.
   - Sidechain the pad or chords lightly to the kick for trap feel.
6. Arrange and build the song following the structure. You can loop sections or expand as needed.

If your DAW supports MIDI channel/track mapping, each file is already separated so you can easily mix/replace sounds.

If automatic generation in this environment failed, run 'generate_midi.py' locally (requires pretty_midi or mido).
